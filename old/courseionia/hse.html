                        selection and iteration (the big three), and develop their problem-solving skills. Learners will learn how to create their own subroutines, develop their understanding of decomposition., <br />
                        learn how to create and use lists, and build upon their problem-solving skills by working through a larger project at the end of the unit.<br />

                        Building on the programming concepts learners used in previous units, they will work in pairs to perform user research, design their app, write the code for it, <br />
                        before finally evaluating and publishing it for the world to use.

                        Learners will be exposed to both global and local data sets and gain an understanding of how visualizing data can help with the process of identifying patterns and trends.<br />
